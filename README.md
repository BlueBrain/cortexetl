# CortexETL

CortexETL is a repository of analyses for characterising and calibrating simulations of in silico cortical models. CortexETL uses [BlueETL](https://bbpgitlab.epfl.ch/nse/blueetl) for data processing and data handling, and uses analyeses from BarrelETL [LINK] for analysis of evoked responses.  

The code was originally written for the calibration and characterization of activity in the Blue Brain Project's model of the rat non-barrel primary somatosensory model. These analyses are described in the preprint: [Modeling and Simulation of Neocortical Micro- and Mesocircuitry. Part II: Physiology and Experimentation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.17.541168v3)

The codebase is is currently being refined for use in other contexts. This will include improved integration with BarrelETL beyond the current solution of including a copy of the repository here.

Please contanct James Isbister for questions / advice on using.


## Getting started
